## Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

This project aims to predict bike sharing demand using AutoGluon, a powerful AutoML toolkit developed by AWS. Bike sharing systems are a popular mode of transportation in many urban areas, and accurately predicting demand can help optimize inventory and resources.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bike Sharing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains hourly and daily counts of bike rentals, along with weather and seasonal information.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
AutoGluon
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional)

# Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook project_notebook (2).ipynb to see the step-by-step implementation of the prediction model using AutoGluon.

# Results
The prediction model achieves a score of 0.85704 on the test dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebook or script output.
